                First impressions matter in business, and a well-designed
                website is essential to capitalize on them. A great website must
                also be useful and user-friendly in addition to being visually
                appealing. I can create slick, aesthetically pleasing websites
                while also coming up with clever answers to technical problems
                thanks to my background as a programmer. I am familiar with
                contemporary building methods in addition to having significant
                understanding of acknowledged technical standards.
                {/* In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale â€” performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar. */}

                I design, even though I{"'"}m probably not the traditional designer
                sitting in front of a figma board tweaking pixels. You{"'"}ll find
                me engrossed in stylesheets, adjusting font sizes and thinking
                about layouts. I{"'"}m dedicated to making fluid user
                experiences while being stylish.
